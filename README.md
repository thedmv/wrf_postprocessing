# WRF: Post-Processing on HPC
This contains a set of files needed to post-process WRF outputs using SLURM. The post processing here is focused on the boundary-layer meteorology of the WRF outputs. The functions can be used to process data from a microwave radiometer and a wind lidar located at The City College of New York.

The functions are primarily written in R, with some Python and Bash mixed in.
